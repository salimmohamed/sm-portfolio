Lately, I realized my daily routine needed a serious upgrade. I was spending most of my time unfocused, jumping between random things without much direction. So I made a change.

Starting today, I’ve built and committed to a structured daily schedule. I now wake up at 8:30 AM, dive into a Udemy course by 9:15, dedicate time to CS projects, and even carved out space for reading at night. I imported it all into my calendar so I stay on track.

This is part of a bigger shift toward becoming more intentional with my time — and I’m excited to see where it leads.

Stay tuned for updates on my progress and more content soon!
